## Stacking

A number of elements are rendered **on top of the WebGL canvas**: axis grid, annotations, SVG elements, etc.
Some of these elements must appear above or behind others, so it's important to control and understand their **stacking order**.

The closest container to all these elements, `canvasWrapper`, creates a new [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context).
This allows its children (both direct and nested) to be stacked in relation with one another _within_ this stacking context (unless some of them define their own stacking context).

### Stacking order

The stacking order is organised into six layers, from furthest (behind) to closest (in front):

1. **WebGL canvas**;
2. **axis system** (including the axis grid);
3. **SVG elements** rendered via [`SvgElement`](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/building-blocks-svgelement--default) into the `svg` overlay, in DOM order;
4. **HTML elements** rendered via [`Html`](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/building-blocks-html--default), in DOM order (including [`Annotation`](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/building-blocks-annotation--default) and [`Overlay`](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/building-blocks-overlay--default));
5. **tooltip**
6. **floating toolbar** (typically with reset zoom button)

```

            │   │ 5. Tooltip                       │
            └── ┤   ┌──────────────────────────────┴───┐
                │   │ 6. Floating toolbar              │
                └── ┤                                  │
                    │                                  │
                    └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

As a consumer of the library, you have control over the stacking of the SVG and HTML elements that you render (i.e. layers 3 and 4).
Within each of these two layers, all you need to do to move element `A` behind, or in front of, element `B` is to **render `A`
before or after `B`** in your React tree, respectively.

However, there are some pitfalls:

- Elements from layers 3 and 4 **cannot be interleaved** with one another. Consider the `svg` overlay as its own stacking context:
  its children are stacked only in relation with one another within their parent SVG document.
- When `Html` and `SvgElement` unmount and then remount (e.g. based on conditions), their children can end up **moving down the DOM tree** and therefore
  in front of other elements that remained in the DOM. This can be worked around in a few ways, as explained below.

### How to avoid unmounting `Html` and `SvgElement`

> This is also better for performance, as mounting `Html` and `SvgElement` is costly.

The simplest solution is to move the rendering condition to the children:

```tsx
<>
  {/* Avoid */}
  {bool && (
    <Annotation x={0} y={0}>
      Foo
    </Annotation>
  )}
  {bool && (
    <Html>
      <p>Bar</p>
    </Html>
  )}
  {bool && (
    <SvgElement>
      <SvgRect />
    </SvgElement>
  )}

  {/* Prefer */}
  <Annotation x={0} y={0}>
    {bool && 'Foo'}
  </Annotation>
  <Html>{bool && <p>Bar</p>}</Html>
  <SvgElement>{bool && <SvgRect />}</SvgElement>
</>
```

Another solution is to conditionally hide the children:

```tsx
<>
  <Html x={0} y={0}>
    <span hidden={bool || undefined}>Foo</span>
  </Html>

  {/* Hide `Annotation`'s internal `div` (works with `Overlay` as well) */}
  <Annotation x={0} y={0} hidden={bool || undefined}>
    Foo
  </Annotation>

  <SvgElement>
    <SvgRect fill={bool ? 'skyblue' : 'transparent'} />
  </SvgElement>
</>
```

### What if DOM order of HTML elements cannot be changed or guaranteed?

If you can't restructure your React tree to render `Html` elements in an order that follows the desired stacking,
or if you can't avoid unmounting/remounting them, the last resort is to **control the stacking order explicitly with `z-index`**.

By default, `Html`'s internal `div` element has no `z-index`, which is equivalent to `z-index: 0`.
Therefore, you can move an `Html` element in front of, or behind, other `Html` elements by giving
it a **positive or negative `z-index`**, respectively.

In the following example, the stacking order is maintained regardless of the React rendering order:

```tsx
<>
  {foo && <Annotation style={{ zIndex: 1 }}>Front</Annotation>}
  {bar && <Annotation style={{ zIndex: -1 }}>Back</Annotation>}
  <Annotation>Middle</Annotation>
</>
```

> To avoid conflicts with the stacking order of other components (grid, tooltip, etc.), please remain within the range `[-999 999]`.

### What if DOM order of SVG elements cannot be changed or guaranteed?

For `SvgElement`, the problem is more complicated, as SVG does not yet provide an equivalent to `z-index`.
A workaround is to not use `SvgElement` at all and instead render an `svg` element yourself via `Html` with the caveats
that this entails (i.e. you have to position and size the SVG element yourself):

```tsx
<Html>
  <svg style={{ zIndex: 1 }}>{/* ... */}</svg>
</Html>
```

### How to display an HTML element behind _all_ SVG elements

While you can't stack `Html` elements _in between_ `SvgElement`s, nothing prevents you from stacking them behind _all_ `SvgElement`s.

The `z-index` of the `svg` overlay is available through CSS variable `--h5w-zi-svgOverlay`,
so if you want an HTML `Overlay`, for instance, to appear behind the `svg` overlay, you can use the following pattern:

```tsx
<Overlay style={{ zIndex: 'calc(var(--h5w-zi-svgOverlay) - 1)' }}>
```
